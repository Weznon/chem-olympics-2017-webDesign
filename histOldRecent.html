    Performance Enhancing Drugs: History - 1860 to 1900
  </title>
  <p><strong>1860 - 1900</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulants</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coffee was a widely used stimulant in the Civil War, used widely by foot soldiers, who known to the other divisions of the army as &ldquo;coffee boilers&rdquo;. This same coffee was also used by academics and other professionals of thought, and, as professional sport began to become popular again, the athletes started to use coffee too, in combination with Alcohol, strychnine, ether, and cocaine. This first trend was in cycling, where managers like &ldquo;Choppy&rdquo; Warburton gave their athletes drugs to last longer in the race. One of Warburton&rsquo;s clients may have died of &ldquo;tri-methyl&rdquo; overdose in 1896 (this is disputed). In American distance-walking competitions, where competitors would walk up to 500 or 600 miles in 6 days, athletes used </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atropa belladonna</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and morphine along the pre-existing repertoire of drugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anabolics</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Edouard Brown-Sequard, physiologist and neurologist, began a craze of testicular injection and ultimately modern organotherapy when over a three week period, he injected himself with blood taken from the testicles, semen, and &ldquo;juice extracted from a testicle...from a dog or guinea pig.&rdquo; starting in June 1889, claiming a &ldquo;rejuvenation&rdquo; had occurred. By 1894, the effects were already being tested on athletes, with favorable results (probably due to the placebo effect), presaging the importance of anabolic steroids in the next century.</span></p>
