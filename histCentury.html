    Performance Enhancing Drugs: History - 20th Century

  <p><strong>The 20th Century through 1988</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anabolics</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pseudoscientific work with testicular extracts and testicular implants continued until 1935, when testosterone was first isolated and synthesised. Understanding of how testosterone works replaced the pseudoscience of the testicular extracts and implants. There are rumors of the Nazi German government giving their athletes steroids during training for the 1936 olympics and giving their soldiers testosterone before battle, but these are assertions without evidence. In 1942, however, there was a recorded use of testosterone on an aging racing horse, who, after a period of decline, proceeded to set a record and win a number of races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul de Kruif&rsquo;s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Male Hormone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which called testosterone &ldquo;what makes bulls bulls&rdquo;, along with scientific studies that supported the claims of effectiveness, to the consistent use of steroids in bodybuilding to this day, starting with West Coast bodybuilders in the 1950s. In professional sports, the pioneers of steroids were the Soviet weightlifters who achieved international success in the 50s.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulants</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old -alcohol, cocaine, strychnine, and caffeine- and the newer nitroglycerine continued to be used throughout the early 20th century, but in the 1930s the discovery of amphetamines&rsquo; stimulant effects would lead to a postwar doping revolution. In the 1930s amphetamines were used by students to stay awake, while in WWII they were used by some armies (e.g. the British) for staying awake, and for others (e.g. the Japanese) to mentally prepare soldiers for suicide missions. This led to a transition to sports: by the late 1960s, amphetamines were everywhere, from the olympics to children&rsquo;s leagues, in all sports, from swimming to car racing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sport with the most infamy in doping, however, was cycling. This infamy was not unfounded: tests in Italy (1965) found that almost half of all professional cyclists were using amphetamines. Thus, it&rsquo;s fitting that the death of Tom Simpson in 1967 (with a bottle of methamphetamine in his pocket) during the Tour de France spurred the first comprehensive attempt to ban doping in history. By the end of the same year, the International Olympics Committee had created &ldquo;doping control programs&rdquo; to steward issues of athlete health, equality, and sports ethics. The very next year, the first Olympic athlete, a Swede, was disqualified, causing the whole Swedish team to lose their medals.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Beginnings of Serious Regulation</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 1970s, doping regulation expanded minimally, namely to anabolic steroid banning and testing, but the real growth of regulation began in the 1980s. In 1983, a surprise use of a steroid test at the Pan American Games led to the withdrawal of a number of American athletes, and the disqualification of almost another score of athletes. Five years later in 1988, Canadian Olympian Ben Johnson lost his medal due to testing positive for an anabolic steroid, stanozolol. This was a major, global doping story that still lingers in the public memory.</span></p>
