    Performance Enhancing Drugs: History - Modern Times
  </title>
  <p><strong>1988-Present</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1988-2000</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Ben Johnson revelation, the regulation of performance enhancing drugs was on a roll. That same year, American President Ronald Reagan signed, as part of his War on Drugs, an act banning the sale of steroids outside of medical use. In the first two years of the following decade, both the United State congress and Major League Baseball passed new regulations on doping (specifically steroids); Congress made steroids a Schedule III drug in 1990, while in 1991 the MLB Commissioner F. Vincent sent a memo to leader of each MLB team, explaining that use of controlled substances (now a class including steroids) by Major League players would not be tolerated. Unfortunately, this letter was not accompanied by any regulations or commitments to testing, so it went virtually ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same year as the MLB memo, a score of former East German coaches attributed their success in women&rsquo;s swimming competitions to a program of anabolic steroids. This admission confirmed suspicion that the sports programs of the Eastern Bloc were built on a tradition of doping. In 1994, this association of Communist states, their elite athletes, and doping, is expanded to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China; its women&rsquo;s swimming team is stripped of 22 gold medals at the 1994 Asian Games. This team would have more than three times more swimmers caught doping in the 90s than any other national women&rsquo;s team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numerous scandals in the 1990s finally led to the formation of the WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, in 1999 followed by the creation of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) the next year. However, in the background, new performance-enhancing drugs were gaining traction, as the stakes became higher and higher. Despite the high morals embodied by the Olympic creed: &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The important thing in the games is not winning but taking part&rdquo;, the . The essential thing is not conquering, but fighting well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. New drugs included Human Growth Hormone, known as HGH, and &ldquo;designer&rdquo; anabolic steroids, designed specifically to avoid detection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substances, 1988-present</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anabolic Steroids (including hard-to detect &ldquo;designer&rdquo; steroids)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steroid Precursors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Growth Hormone (HGH)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cocaine</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caffeine</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marijuana</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2000-present</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the years since the turn of the turn of the century, there have been almost innumerable doping scandals in American and international sports. This rise in scandals shows that anti-doping regulations and tests have become better: despite the regulations starting in the late 60s, doping has only increased in sporting: it simply is too lucrative. From the BALCO scandal involving everyone from American Olympic track stars to Major League Baseball 7 time MVP Barry Bonds, to the ongoing Russian and Chinese doping scandals, to Lance Armstrong being stripped of 7 Tour de France titles, those guilty of doping have been caught and successfully persecuted time and time again. The supposedly undetectable &ldquo;designer&rdquo; steroids and HGH now can be tested for, first tested positively in 2002 and in 2007, respectively. And so the arms race continues to this day; for the foreseeable future, athlete s will use performance enhancing drugs and regulators will try to stop them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PED Usage in Baseball</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">History</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First usages of PEDS was in 1889, by Pud Galvin; he attempted to use testosterone from other animals as a PED, in what he called "Brown Sequard Elixir". &nbsp;Babe Ruth also tried this, but only fell ill from his attempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steroids appeared in the 1970s. Tom House told the public that 6/7 players per team were using/experimenting with the drugs. Steroids became less popular during 1980s, when amphetamines appeared, but by 1990, steroids had regained popularity. Statistics of the time point to an anomaly, as 2 players hit 60+ homeruns in one season, while only 1 had from 1927 to 1998. In the three following years, 3 did, which seemed even stranger. These 3 players were later linked to steroids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2003, MLB conducted a test to test prevalence of PED usage (full study found at </span><a href="http://www.baseballssteroidera.com/2003-steroid-list-anonymous-survey-testing.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.baseballssteroidera.com/2003-steroid-list-anonymous-survey-testing.htm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). 104 players tested positive for PEDs, or about 5% of players at this time. As a result of this test, drug testing was implemented in the MLB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Present</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As increasing eye on steroids has appeared, steroids have fallen out of use yet again, and players are using Testosterone and HGH. HGH was banned in 2005 (one year after the ban on steroids) but MLB does not test for the drug, as the test may have questionable accuracy and is difficult to administer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>The BALCO Scandal</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BALCO scandal involved athletes from many sports, but the main athletes were in track and field. Baseball, football, and wrestling athletes were also involved. In 2002 the BALCO lab began to be investigated, for suspected sales of PEDs to athletes. In 2003 an anonymous tip is sent to USADA with syringe of steroids developed by BALCO. This sample was at the time undetectable. Over time the people involved were tried &nbsp;and found guilty of distributing drugs.</span></p>
