<li><strong><strong>Formation </strong>Stanozolol is a artificial anabolic steroid. Stanozolol is formed through a series of synthesis reactions. It derives from dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone is created from testosterone via the enzyme 5a-reductase, which reduces the C4-5 bond leading to the Formation of CH bonds thus creating dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone forms from a condensation reaction from 3-keto-aldehyde-oxymetholone with hydrazine. This is favorable for sports enhancement because unlike dihydrotestosterone it cannot be metabolized into estrogen which can lead to unwanted side effects such as water retention, and high blood pressure. </strong></li>

<li><strong>Effects</strong> on the body. Stanozolol affects the body in 2 primary ways, through increasing red blood cell count and increasing muscle mass. Stanozolol binds with an androgen receptor to increase the expression of muscle protein. It increases the red blood cell count also through expressing the proteins needed for the red blood cell production.</li>

<li><strong>Detection</strong> Stanozolol&rsquo;s functional group causes the liver to change its chemical structure but not metabolize it. In result detection tests such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of the urine sample allows the detection of stanozolol in the the origin of the urine sample&rsquo;s system.</li>
