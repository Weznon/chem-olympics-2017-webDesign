    Performance Enhancing Drugs: History - Fall of Rome to Industrial Revolution
  </title>
  <p><strong>The Fall of the Western Roman Empire (c. 476 CE) - The Second Industrial Revolution (c. 1860)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this approximately fourteen-hundred-year period, there was a dearth in Europe of organized sports and thus the use of performance enhancing drugs. Because Europe was the sole center of performance enhancing drugs until the globalization of organized sport by the great European colonial and imperial powers, to say that there was a dearth of organized sport in Europe is to say that there was little organized sport in the world at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due the scarcity of organized sport, the concoctions that had formerly been for athletes were now used for warriors and in the field of medicine (studied extensively in the Islamic Empire, where a flowering of culture, wealth, power, arts, and sciences was underway). Knights in Continental Europe used stimulants (the names of which are long since lost) to increase endurance on the battlefield, the fabled Berserkers of Scandinavia and the Samoyeds of Siberia (a Uralic people descended from the ancestors of the Vikings) used a mushroom we call &ldquo;fly-agaric&rdquo; for the effects of the chemical bufotenin. However, this mushroom also contains a lethal alkaloid that we know as &ldquo;muscarine&rdquo;. In terms of medicine, the consumption of organs to improve various aspects of health, also known as organotherapy, was in style (at least throughout the early medieval period). Doctors prescribed brains for intelligence, hearts for valor, and testicular extract for fertility and libido, still in continuation of the ancient Greek tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also a good, and chronologically accurate, moment to discuss the traditional herbal remedies from outside of Europe. While these regions had little organized sports, there were still (and in small part are still) traditional medicines that were used to treat illness and enhance performance. For example, West African people used Cola acuminita and Cola nitida to enhance speed for running contests, the andean Native Americans used coca leaves and tea, and the Tarahumara of the desert of northern Mexico used peyote, which has effects similar to strychnine, a poisonous performance-enhancer that was to become very popular around the turn of the 20th century. &nbsp;</span></p>
