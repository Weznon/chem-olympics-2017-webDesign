    Performance Enhancing Drugs: History - Ancient Greece and Rome
  </title>
  <p><strong>Ancient Greece </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the period where the practice of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) can be said to have begun. During the Olympic Games (776 BCE - 393 BCE), athletes competed in high stakes competition, where everything to improve one&rsquo;s performance (outside of rigging the game or the judges) was fair game. Common techniques included &ldquo;wine potions&rdquo; along with eating large quantities of meat, chewing on raw animal testicles, and using hallucinogens such as mushrooms. In other words, the ancient Greek athletes used performance enhancing drugs as just another method to achieve success, and with it the gold and glory, much like the athletes of the present day, still competing for monetary prizes, wreaths, and medals. A major difference, however, between the ancient Greek use of PEDs and PED use in sports today can be found in the drug(s) of choice: the Greeks&rsquo; favorite was opium, which would later (from the Dutch &lsquo;doop&rsquo;) spawn the term dope.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Rome</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same factors (gold and glory) drive the use of performance enhancing drugs, but now with the popularity of gladiatorial combat in the Roman Empire, as opposed to the more track-and-field focused Greek sporting culture, a new motivation begins to emerge - gore. Gladiators would not just take drugs or use other remedies to lessen pain, but also to increase bleeding &ldquo;to create a bloodier spectacle for viewers&rdquo; (and thus gain more gold and glory). Gladiatorial combat was not the only sport in rome, however, and performance enhancing drugs were commonplace in all sports, from chariot racing, where horses were fed a honey-derived alcohol called &ldquo;hydromel&rdquo; in an attempt to make them run faster, to foot racing, where runners continued the Greek tradition of ingesting raw animal testicles and semen for a pre-game boost. Concisely, the Romans continued the Greek traditions of performance enhancing drugs and developed their own advancements to suit their more militaristic culture (as the Romans did in other fields such as engineering and architecture).</span></p>
